# Frontend for Automated Time Series Forecasting

This repository contains the **simplified frontend** for my capstone project:  
**_“Automated Time Series Forecasting: Using Hybrid Forecasting Approach.”_**

 <p>
    Refer to this link for the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ezv9vKa8NNZ1Isd4c1vs9Tl0QWcCdldI/view?usp=sharing"> research's extended abstract. </a> You can read the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jun-jun-zaragosa/details/projects/"> full document </a> and explore my other projects.

Originally, the full system was implemented using **PHP’s Laravel framework** (serving Blade templates) alongside a dedicated **Python Flask application** for the core forecasting logic.  

For this simplified version, I’ve rewritten the backend with a clean separation between backend and frontend:  
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Python Flask (lightweight and fast for development)

## Core Functionality
This React web application allows the user to interact with the hybrid time series forecasting model that was developed during the research. Specifically, it has the following:
- Input time series data
- Preprocess the data
- Allow modification on forecast options
- Forecast time series base on specified steps
- Provide AI explanation on the results.
